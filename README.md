# jscommand
This module adds the /js command which allows one to write javascript code directly to chat. Main purpose: doing quick math calculations while storing the data in volatile variables that reset every /ct reload or every time Minecraft is restarted. While typing the javascript code there is a preview of the output to chat with a nicely formatted box. The output of the numbers gets formatted in a Hypixel Skyblock fashion (but can be easily disabled).
