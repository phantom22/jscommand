# jscommand
This module adds the **/js** command which allows one to write javascript code directly to chat.

### Purpose
doing quick math calculations while storing the data in volatile variables that reset every /ct reload or whenever Minecraft is restarted. 

### Ease of use
While typing the javascript code there is a preview of the output to chat with a nicely formatted box. 
The output of the numbers can be formatted in a Hypixel Skyblock fashion when needed.

The **/js help** lists how to customize some features.
